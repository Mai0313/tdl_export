## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to behave professionally and respectfully. Personal attacks, harassment, and discriminatory language are not tolerated. By participating, you agree to uphold a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Ways to Contribute

- Reporting bugs and reproducible issues
- Proposing or implementing new features
- Improving documentation, examples, and tutorials
- Reviewing pull requests and providing constructive feedback
- Suggesting tooling, performance, or security improvements

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Confirm the problem reproduces on the latest release or `main`.
3. Use the appropriate issue template.

Please include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- The Python version, OS, and project version or commit
- Minimal reproduction steps and a code snippet when applicable
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Full stack traces, logs, or screenshots

## Development Setup

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python and dependency management.

```bash
# Install uv (one-time setup)
make uv-install

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

# Install dependencies and create the virtual environment
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

Supported Python versions are declared in `pyproject.toml`. Use `uv` to manage interpreters when needed:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
```

## Local Workflow

Common tasks are exposed via the `Makefile`. Run `make help` to list all targets. Frequently used ones:

```bash
make fmt       # Run pre-commit hooks (ruff, mdformat, codespell, ty, ...)
make test      # Run the test suite
make gen-docs  # Generate documentation
make clean     # Remove caches and build artifacts
```

Always run `make fmt` and `make test` before opening a pull request.

## Testing

- Tests are written with **pytest** and live under `tests/`.
- Coverage is enforced at **80%** minimum; new code should not lower the project's coverage.
- Use `pytest-xdist` for parallel execution where helpful.

Useful commands:

```bash
uv run pytest                       # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_foo.py     # Run a single file
uv run pytest -k "expression"       # Run tests matching an expression
uv run pytest --cov                 # Run with coverage
```

Add tests for every behavioral change. Bug fixes should include a regression test.

## Documentation

Documentation uses **Zensical** with `mkdocstrings` and lives under `docs/`. To preview locally:

```bash
make gen-docs
uv run zensical serve  # http://0.0.0.0:9987
```

Update README, docstrings, and examples when changing public behavior. Documentation contributions are first-class and very welcome.

## Branching Model

- `main` is the default branch and must always be releasable.
- Feature branches: `feat/<short-description>`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/<short-description>`
- Documentation branches: `docs/<short-description>`

## Commit Convention

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and **must be written in English**.

Format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

Allowed types:

| Type       | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                           |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                               |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `doc`      | Documentation-only changes                              |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                 |
| `style`    | Formatting or stylistic changes                         |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                              |
| `chore`    | Build, tooling, or auxiliary changes                    |
| `ci`       | Continuous integration changes                          |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit                             |

Append `!` after the type or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer to indicate a breaking change. Reference issues with `Closes #123` or `Refs #123`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the target branch.
2. Run `make fmt` and `make test` locally; both must pass.
3. Ensure CI checks pass on the pull request.
4. Use a descriptive title following the commit convention; it is validated by **semantic-pull-request**.
5. Fill out the pull request template, including motivation, summary, and testing notes.
6. Link related issues and design documents.
7. Mark the PR as **draft** while still in progress.
8. Request review only after self-review and a green CI.

Pull requests are typically merged via **squash merge** to keep history linear.

## Code Review

- Address all review comments or explain why a change is not needed.
- Keep discussions technical, focused, and respectful.
- Resolve conversations only after the concern has been addressed.

## Coding Standards

- **Formatting and linting**: handled by `ruff` (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Typing**: `ty` with strict rules, running against the project environment so first-party imports resolve; new code should be type-annotated
- **Spelling**: enforced by `codespell` via pre-commit
- **Notebooks**: stripped of outputs by `nbstripout`

Prefer clarity over cleverness, and avoid unrelated refactors in feature or fix pull requests.

## Security Reports

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public issues. Refer to [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure process.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (see [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE)). Ensure that you have the right to submit any code, content, or assets you contribute.
